    <h1>Welcome to the Thought Police!</h1>
    <h3>click on the traitors in red overalls to vaporize them!</h3>
    <p>The people in blue overalls are good loyal party members. Those in red are thought criminals that must be disposed of. Click on them to vaporize them and replace them with mindless, loyal party members (The Party insists that having red eyes is a good thing). Be careful though, overzealous clicking will upset the citezens and create more traitors! Have fun and please give me a 100% for this reflection.</p>
