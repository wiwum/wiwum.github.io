    <h1>Here is some data I collected about the speed bumps on Jester Blvd:</h1>
    <p>The speedbumps are on a curve, so measuring them is somewhat complex. I used a measuring wheel to gather this data:</p>
    <br>
    <p>at their furthest apart (on the arc), they are 511.5 ft apart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>at their closest together (one the arc), they are 510 ft apart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the speed bumps are 7 feet long and 6 feet wide.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the distance between the speedbumps in each lane is 3ft 10in.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the distance between the speedbumps in the middle of the two lanes is 4ft 11in.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the speedbumps are not flat. (<a href="wiwum.github.io/speed-bumps/pictures/">see pictures of speedbumps</a>) </p>
