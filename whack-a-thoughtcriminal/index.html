    <h1>Welcome to the Thought Police!</h1>
    <h3>Click on the traitors in red overalls to vaporize them!</h3>
    <p>The people in blue overalls are good, loyal party members. Those in red are thought criminals that must be disposed of. Click on them to vaporize them and replace them with mindless, loyal party members (The Party insists that having red eyes is a good, trustworthy thing). Be careful though, overzealous clicking will upset the citizens and create more traitors! Have fun and please give me a 100% for this reflection.</p>
    <p>"Only the Thought Police matter" (Orwell 3).</p>
    <p>"The Thought Police [will] get [anyone] just the same" (Orwell 15).</P>
    <p>How efficient are the Thought Police as an organization and why is it worth while for the Party to opperate them?</P>
